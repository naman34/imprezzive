# Imprezzive

There are many browser-based presentation frameworks out there. In the many tech conferences, these projects are used for showing off code snippets. However, despite the web being an inherently interactive medium, none of these frameworks enable simple editing while presentation. And none of the existing frameworks provide a a powerful way to showcase code and run it.

Imprezzive tries to fill that hole. Built during a hackathon, Imprezzive currently give you a simple Tron-inspired interface that lets you put Headings, text, images and code. The code is put in an Ace editor that has been custom themed to give it a transparent background. Using Web Workers, code in Ace editors can be run safely and the results can be seen. You can even have multiple Ace editors on the same slide to compare two code blocks.

Using Sails.js and Socket.io, the entire Backbone app is made for real-time collaboration.

### Bugs

Imprezzive has a few bugs at the moment and isn't quite ready for prime-time. It's still a great choice for downloading and running locally on your own computer.

### Future

There are many improvments and features to be added to Imprezzive. Expect some, but not all, of the following

- Multiple Themes
- Presentation, Read Only mode
- Remote Control
- Slide-by-Slide Voting mote
- Better animations
- Build Animations
- Something else I haven't thought of
